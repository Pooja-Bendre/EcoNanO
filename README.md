# EcoNanO
EcoNanO - AI Urban App for Nanoplastic Monitoring and Urban Design Recommendations

Project Description :

EcoNanO (AIUrbanApp) is an innovative mobile application developed to assist urban planners and residents in monitoring nanoplastic pollution levels and optimizing urban layouts for cleaner environments. The app leverages AI to analyze pollution data from IoT sensors in real-time, providing insights and recommendations for creating greener, healthier cities. EcoNanO provides features like live pollution data visualization, health alerts, and city planning tools aimed at reducing human exposure to harmful nanoplastics.

Key Features :

Real-Time Pollution Monitoring: Visualize pollution levels from IoT sensors, focused on nanoplastics in the air and water.

AI-Powered Analysis: AI models predict pollution trends and provide personalized alerts based on user location.

Urban Design Recommendations: Suggestions for optimal placement of green spaces, biofilters, and other environmental controls.

GIS Mapping: Integration with Mapbox/GIS services to display pollution data on city maps.

Personalized Health Notifications: Users receive alerts based on real-time pollution exposure and their health risk profile.
